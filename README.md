Bicycle joyride game in javascript

Playable in modern browsers that support HTML5 and canvas. Use arrowkeys to turn and pedal the bicycle. Riding in grass slows the bike, and running into obstacles stops it.

The game uses a static tile set and map object to play a basic one-level isometric game. I'm using this set of code as a simple starting point to make other javascript game experiments.
